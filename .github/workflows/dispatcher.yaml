# This workflow serves as the dispatcher for the CI/CD pipeline, acting as a filter to ensure that the
# pipeline runs only when necessary. It should be placed in a separate file to prevent triggering the
# CI/CD workflow when conditions are not met, as this could lead to incorrect behavior for bots that
# depends on the successful execution of specific jobs.
